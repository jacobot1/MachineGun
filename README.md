# MachineGun

UPDATE: Knockback removed. Use my [LethalKnockback](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SeismicMods/LethalKnockback/) mod to achieve the same effect (but better).

- Adds a rebindable key (default 'f') to use the Shotgun in Machine Gun mode. Hold it down to continuously fire at a configurable rate (in shots per second).

- Currently gives the Shotgun infinite ammo (may have to load it initially). However, in the future I'd like to see Ammo become Magazines and for the Shotgun to get a new skin.
